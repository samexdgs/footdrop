Foot Drop Management  

This project was developed as part of my final year research to demonstrate how machine learning can be integrated into the management of neurological conditions such as foot drop.  

I co-contributed to the ideation, system design, and overall implementation of the project. The goal was to build a data-driven framework for real-time detection and correction of gait abnormalities.  

The system leverages supervised learning models — including LightGBM, Random Forest, and XGBoost — to analyze user inputs, predict potential causes of gait deviation, and recommend targeted interventions such as exercise regimens or corrective actions.  

This work has been fully documented and is currently under peer review for publication.
